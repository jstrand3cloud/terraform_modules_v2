# Module/Stack Name Here
Key Vault Module. As assumption around the default Key Vault Access policy will be defined for the creating principal. Can be completely opted out, for RBAC authorization.

# Notes

This module intentionally does not support the "contact" block. The "key_vault_certificate_contacts" module should be used instead.
